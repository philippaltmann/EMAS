Rules:
  # Utilities
  # This rule defines the collision mechanic, introduces a related DoneCondition and lets you specify rewards.

  # Done Conditions
  # Define the conditions for the environment to stop. Either success or a fail conditions
  # The environment stops when all coin is cleaned
  DoneOnAllCoinsCollected:

  # Define how agents spawn.
  # Options: "random" (Spawn agent at a random position from the list of defined positions)
  # "first" (Always spawn agent at first position regardless of the other provided positions)
  # "order" (Loop through agent positions)
